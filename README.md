## What is ClueCon?
[ClueCon](https://www.cluecon.com/) is a conference for developers by developers: an annual technology conference held every summer hosted by the team behind the [FreeSWITCH](https://freeswitch.com) open-source project. Our primary focus is to gather various open source projects to discuss Voice over IP, open-source software and hardware, Telecommunications, WebRTC, and IoT. We sit at the intersection of communication and technology and we love all things technical. Open source projects represented many years are FreeSWITCH, Kamailio, Asterisk, OpenSIPS, FusionPBX and many more!

ClueCon started 15 years ago as a space to discuss the world of telecom and now it has grown into an amazing tool for developers! Catch qualified speakers, discuss projects with peers, build creative machines at our hack-a-thon, meet likeminded people at our networking events, and enjoy a few surprises along the way. See you there!
